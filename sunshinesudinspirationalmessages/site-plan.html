      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        On the Internet, we can find any content type such as tutorials, news, scientific articles, recipes, etc. That is pretty cool! But, I often have difficulty finding inspiring content or, better saying, messages that bring relief and uplift to the soul. Why not? Our days have been so hard! We often have to deal with stressful situations, anxiety, overwhelmed by daily routine, illness, and familiar or financial problems, anyway. And we can use this world communication channel to share some things to strengthen or somehow help to overcome every obstacle in our lives. This kind of content can build us and help us become better people to we don't get swallowed by all these terrible events. Feeding our souls is a necessity!
      </p>
      <p>In this context, I would like to share messages by inspired people from The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. These messages are a guide and can answer questions about our personal lives or what the Lord wants for us. These leaders talk about things that bring us happiness and how to avoid other situations that can destroy us, how to have a Christ-centered life, which attributes we can improve to become a better people, and the importance of agency and choices for example education and wedding that can influence ours lives, and mainly, messages about the love The Lord feels for every His children, we are precious to Him and, everyone can change strengthened by this love. I remember when my son was born and how I fell lost whit that situation. In season, I read the words of Elder Jeffrey H. Holland. He talk: "When you have come to the Lord in meekness and lowliness of heart and, as one mother said, “pounded on the doors of heaven to ask for, to plead for, to demand guidance and wisdom and help for this wondrous task,” that door is thrown open to provide you the influence and the help of all eternity. Claim the promises of the Savior of the world." This is so important to a hopeless mother!

      </ul>
      <h3>Little Things</h3>
      <p>
        Another way that I found to share this kind of content is through song lyrics or reviewing movies. I always take a lot of time looking for one option movie to watch because I like a good story! I think what I can learn about that history. Frequently, I see life lessons in children's movies and movies based on facts of real life. Is it makes sense for you?  In general, they are made to teach about some principles of life. Another point, it's interesting to see the power of music in our thoughts and how it can change our mood or behavior. When I listen to a good song and feel glad and relieved to face a heavy routine because of its sweet melody or incredible lyrics. The Lord wants us that we can learn with little things. I want to share these feelings and thoughts with the world. "You've got a friend in me" (Toy Story Movie)

      <h3>They inspire generations!</h3>
      <p>
        Many personalities have influenced multitudes when still are live or same after death in human history. They became world leaders because of the purpose they had. This way, they have encouraged other generations to do the same and improve human abilities. I love to know better Thomas Edison A. Edison. He said: "I didn't fail 1000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1000 steps." when he finished the invention of the light bulb. This way, I learned that I have to try many times until to reach my goals in life. Every failure is one step toward learning and every mistake is one opportunity to grow. Don't give up on our dreams although obstacles!
