            <p>Another way that I found to share this kind of content is through song lyrics or reviewing movies. I always take a lot of time looking for one option movie to watch because I like a good story! I think what I can learn about that history. Frequently, I see life lessons in children's movies and movies based on facts of real life. Is it makes sense for you?  In general, they are made to teach about some principles of life. Another point, it's interesting to see the power of music in our thoughts and how it can change our mood or behavior. When I listen to a good song and feel glad and relieved to face a heavy routine because of its sweet melody or incredible lyrics. The Lord wants us that we can learn with little things. I want to share these feelings and thoughts with the world. "You've got a friend in me" (Toy Story Movie)
